## ‚ùì What is Front Matter?

Front Matter is a CMS that runs within Visual Studio Code. It gives you the power and control of a full-blown CMS while also providing you the flexibility and speed of the static site generator of your choice. Jump right into editing and creating content with Front Matter and be able to preview it straight in VS Code.

The extension supports various static-site generators and frameworks like Hugo, Jekyll, Hexo, NextJs, Gatsby, and more.

A couple of our extension highlights that hopefully get you interested in giving Front Matter a try:

- Content, data, and media management
  - Search, filter, sort, etc. all your content
  - Create new content
  - Supporting tools to edit content and media
- Preview your site/content straight in Visual Studio Code
- SEO checks for title, description, and keywords
- Extensibility
  - As we know, we cannot support all use cases. We provide a way to extend the functionality of the extension to your needs
- and many more features ...

> Data files/folders are pieces of content that do not belong to any markdown content, but live on their own. Most of the time, these data files are used to store additional information about your project/blog/website that will be used to render the content.

The new media dashboard redesign got introduced + support for setting metadata on media files [v5.0.0 release notes](https://frontmatter.codes/updates/v5.0.0).

**Version 3**

In version v3 we introduced the welcome and dashboard webview. The welcome view allows to get you started using the extension, and the dashboard allows you to manage all your markdown pages in one place. This makes it easy to search, filter, sort, and more.

**Version 2**

In version v2 we released the re-designed sidebar panel with improved SEO support. This extension makes it the only extension to manage your Markdown pages for your static sites in Visual Studio Code.
